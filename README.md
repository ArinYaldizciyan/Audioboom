## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd audioboom
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=audioboom
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=public

# Add any other required environment variables
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file for API configurations:

```env
# Real-Debrid API
REALDEBRID_API_KEY=your_realdebrid_api_key

# Jackett Configuration
JACKETT_API_KEY=your_jackett_api_key

# Security Configuration
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_chosen_password  # Password required to access the application
```

## Security

Audioboom uses a simple but effective security model for personal use:

- **Password Protection**: A single admin password protects access to the entire application
- **Cookie-based Auth**: Successful login creates a secure HTTP-only cookie
- **Production Security**:
  - Secure cookies enabled in production
  - Strict same-site policy
  - 1-week session duration

This security model is designed for personal use where you're hosting the application for yourself or a small trusted group. It's simple to set up and maintain while providing basic protection against unauthorized access.

## API Configuration Guide

### Real-Debrid Setup

1. Sign up for a Real-Debrid account at [real-debrid.com](https://real-debrid.com)
2. Generate an API key from your account settings
3. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file

### Jackett Setup

1. Install and configure Jackett on your system
2. Add your preferred torrent indexers
3. Copy your API key from Jackett
4. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file

The base URLs and endpoints are configured in `src/config/api.ts`. You can modify these values based on your setup:

```typescript
export const API_CONFIG = {
  REALDEBRID: {
    BASE_URL: "https://api.real-debrid.com/rest/1.0",
    // ... other Real-Debrid config
  },
  JACKETT: {
    BASE_URL: "http://127.0.0.1:9117", // Update this to match your Jackett installation
    // ... other Jackett config
  },
};
```
